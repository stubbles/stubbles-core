/**
 * Sequence is a stream of data that can be operated on.
 *
 * Sequence operations are divided into intermediate and terminal operations,
 * and are combined to form pipelines. A pipeline consists of a source (such as
 * a Collection, an array, a generator function, or an I/O channel); followed by
 * zero or more intermediate operations such as Sequence::filter() or
 * Sequence::map(); and a terminal operation such as Sequence::each() or
 * Sequence::reduce().
 *
 * Intermediate operations return a new Sequence. They are always lazy;
 * executing an intermediate operation such as Sequence::filter() does not
 * actually perform any filtering, but instead creates a new Sequence that, when
 * traversed, contains the elements of the initial stream that match the given
 * predicate. Traversal of the pipeline source does not begin until the terminal
 * operation of the pipeline is executed.
 *
 * Terminal operations, such as Sequence::each() or Sequence::reduce(), may
 * traverse the Sequence to produce a result or a side-effect. After the
 * terminal operation is performed, the pipeline is considered consumed, and can
 * no longer be used; if you need to traverse the same data source again, you
 * must return to the data source to get a new Sequence. In almost all cases,
 * terminal operations are eager, completing their traversal of the data source
 * and processing of the pipeline before returning. Only the terminal operation
 * Sequence::getIterator() is not; this is provided as an "escape hatch" to
 * enable arbitrary client-controlled pipeline traversals in the event that the
 * existing operations are not sufficient to the task.
